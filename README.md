### 👯 Apart from my work, I love

🧘🏻‍♀️ **Pilates**: it's low-intensity exercise but helps to train core strength and muscle throughout full body
<br>

### I’m currently learning

**UX concept and UX design**: 
Due to my work, I analysed several websites, and in many cases, the problems were not visible when a first glance at the dataset or reading a data report, and most of the issues are due to poor design. Hence, it was the reason I learned UX to provide better insights to inform my team and clients for further improvement.

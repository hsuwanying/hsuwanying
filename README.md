### Hey there! I'm Carol

### A little about me: Career transition from fashion to tech
For the past ten years, I’ve excelled in customer experience in different business sectors mainly in fashion retailing. With a growing interest in data analytics, I decided to take a master's degree focusing on the application of Data Science in early 2020. In 2022, I started a position as a data analyst at MarketVision AG.

Due to my work, I analysed several websites, and in many cases, the issues were due to poor designs, which were not visible to find at first glance of the data; I have learned some UX concepts during my study and UX design from [Google](https://coursera.org/share/6b213706bc3ac25c2e10b8f731f26cbf), [Linkedln](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/me/my-library/completed). I found that UX is not only to make a pretty design for web applications but a problem-solving approach to help me sharpen my thoughts and insights that support my team and clients with informed decision-making.
